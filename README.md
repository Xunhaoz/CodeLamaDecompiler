# CodeLamaDecompiler

## Project purpose

Decompilation restores compiled code to readable source code, allowing security researchers to analyze the inner
workings of closed source software. Through decompilation, you can discover potential security holes, backdoors or
malicious code in the program, which helps to discover and repair security issues in a timely manner. At the same time,
decompilation can also be used to check whether the software complies with the license agreement and verify its security
statement.

## Project Overview

This project aims to use the Linux kernel as a training data set to enhance the decompilation capabilities of the
code-Llama model. The main goal is to achieve two tasks:

1. End-to-end decompilation: generate readable C code directly from assembly code (ASM)
2. Pseudocode refinement: Convert pseudocode generated by IDA Pro into more readable C code

## Technical Details
Below is a rough overview, with more detailed explanations available in the README files within each subfolder.
### Data Set Preparation

- Linux kernel source code(4 major version)
- Generate assembly code and corresponding C code pairs
- Use IDA Pro to generate pseudocode and pair it with original C code

### Model Training

- LoRA fine-tuning based on code-Llama model
- Train separately for two different tasks

### Mission details

#### a. End-to-end decompilation

- Input: assembly code
- Output: corresponding high-level C code
- Challenge: Infer high-level semantics directly from low-level instructions

#### b. Pseudocode refinement

- Input: Pseudocode generated by IDA Pro
- Output: corresponding high-level C code
- Goal: Improve code readability and restore original program structure
